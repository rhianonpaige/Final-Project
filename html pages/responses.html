      <h2>Critical Atlas of Internet</h2>

      So let me give you 10 reasons why you might need a website for your business:

      <h2>1. It Impacts Your Credibility </h2>

      <blockquote>
      According to Sweor.com: “It takes about 50 milliseconds (that’s 0.05 seconds) for users to form an opinion about your website that determines whether they like your site or not, whether they’ll stay or leave.“
      </blockquote>

      As the old saying goes: “You can only make the first impression once.”

      When someone first comes across your business, you want to appear credible.

      You want to have an amazing website and social media presence that show the results that you’re delivering and testimonials that you’re getting.
